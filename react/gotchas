1. Component should return one item only.
   If I want my component to be presented by two or more say divs, which lie right 
   to each other, then I have to wrap them up with one more div.

2. A lot of event handlers in main component.
   Events from child components flow up to the main component (the holder 
   of the app state). Which is reasoble, because this is the idea of predictable
   data flow in React. But so many handlers occuire in main component...
   React "contexts" is for the resque here, but it can broke explicit data flow,
   that's why this feature is still not officialy documented.
