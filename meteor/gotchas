1. Template scoped reactive state.
   Solution: ReactiveVar
   
2. Sending collection count to client.
   "Publish function can only return a Cursor or an array of Cursors".
   Solution: tmeasday:publish-counts
   
3. No MVVM support (two-way bindings) - no view to viewmodel binding.
   Solution: manuel:viewmodel
   
   "What happens if you encounter a situation where you can't use view models, 
    for example, you can't bind to an element for whatever reason? 
    The answer is simple: you do it in good old Blaze/Meteor."
   
   3.a viewmodel does not apply click handler on partial render inside {{# if }}
       data-bind='visible: bool'
       Solution: https://github.com/ManuelDeLeon/viewmodel/issues/93
   3.b viewmodel does not see {{# each }}-context and unable to use context's
       properties inside 'data-bind'
       Solution: Move to separate template or use vanila one-way binding.
   3.c unable to use expressions in data-bind, like
       "class: {'myclass': state === 'value'}"
       Solution: Add separate vm helper, like
                 "class: {'myclass': eq('state', 'value')}"
   
4. Long (auto)updates in c9 environment
   Solution: Preriodically restart meteor server 

5. Sorting not obviously should be done both on server (pub) and client (sub),
   because server sends only documents that client's local db does not have.
   
6. Several subscriptions for the same collection (list and selected item).
   Publications of the same collection are merged, and selected item always added 
   to the list, even if it should not be on current page.

7. Passing parameters to template kills reactivity of #each data context 
   inside nested template, because parameters object is not reactive datasource.
   Solution: Inside nested template use '../each_data_context_property' from html, 
             or Template.parentData() from code
             or this.templateInstance.view.templateInstance().data for reactivity
             
   7.a Template.parentData() failes with 'view not set' error when Blaze 
       is not in render phaze (?).
       Cache parent data when Blaze is right phaze (Template.instance() is not null).
       Solution: do not use Template.parentData().
       
8. Annoying auto-refreshes when uploading images to public folder at runtime.
   Solution: Use separate folder '.uploads' and request handler to serve from there

9. Error on start of todo list app from tutorial.
   "Unable to locate babel-helpers module"
   Solution: remove ecmascript package from user/AppRoaming

10. Auto-reload extremely slow on changes.
    Change single line in .js file - 20sec to rebuild.
    https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/4284

11. Unable to use CSS Modules.
    No official support. Existing 'nathantreid/meteor-css-modules' package does not work with latest meteor version.
