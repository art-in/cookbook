ASP.NET MVC

- MVC Controllers and WebAPI Controllers exist in separate namespaces 
  and require separate references.
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11990036/how-to-add-web-api-to-an-existing-asp-net-mvc-4-web-application-project

- Referencing HTML resources from node_modules/, which is outside of root
  asp.net app folder (one level upper; e.g. I want packages.json in git root).
  Have to add virtual directory to .vs\config\applicationhost.config
  site > application >
  <virtualDirectory path="/node_modules" physicalPath="absolute\node_modules"/>
  OR
  Just add resource to webpack bundle

Entity Framework 6

- Updating related entities while updating parent one.
  Surprisingly requires too much dance: manually find all entities
  that were added and add them to db context, same for deleted entities.

Webpack build

- Incremented build is slow (~5 sec)
  Do not minify on incremental build (~1 sec). Still slow.
  Use 'eval-source-map' (~300 ms). Pretty good.

- Sometimes stops rebuild on changes (with no errors)

- Too long build log (mainly because of vendor modules: babel, angular)
  stats.toString({chunks:false})

- Sourcemaps are hard to debug.
  -- Cannot get value of local variable.
  -- Jumps between source and build

IDE

- ES2015 syntax is not supported in VS2015 (modules, arrow functions, etc.)
  Have to disable VS errors for js files completely, and use R# inspections
- Some experimental ES features are not supported even in R# (decorators)
  Have to disable R# inspections completely (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+8 for file, 
  or ReSharper > Options > Code Inspection > Settings)

Angular2 (beta.0)

- "Expression ___ has changed after it was checked"-error
  Dev-mode error that will raise if model changes found on second digest, 
  right after first one. That means changes were initiated by digest itself.
  So if you binding to function that will return new array each time, this
  error will be thrown. Even if returned array is the same.
