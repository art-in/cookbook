ASP.NET MVC

- MVC Controllers and WebAPI Controllers exist in separate namespaces 
  and require separate references.

Webpack build

- Incremented build is slow (~5 sec)
  Do not minify on incremental build (~1 sec). Still slow.
  Use 'eval-source-map' (~300 ms). Pretty good.

- Too long build log (mainly because of vendor modules: babel, angular)
  stats.toString({chunks:false})

- Sourcemaps are hard to debug.
  -- Cannot get value of local variable.
  -- Jumps between source and build

IDE

- ES2015 syntax is not supported in VS2015 (modules, arrow functions, etc.)
  Have to disable VS errors for js files completely, and use R# inspections
- Some experimental ES features are not supported even in R# (decorators)
